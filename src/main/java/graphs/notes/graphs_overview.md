####Graphs:

A collection of nodes/vertices with edges between (some of) them. 
   G = (V,E)
   V = set of vertices
   E = set of edges

Graphs can either be:
* Directed, ordered pairs (one way)
* Undirected, unordered pairs (two way)

A graph may consist of multiple isolated subgraphs. If there is a path between every pair of vertices it is called a 'connected graph'. 

#####Representation:
Adjacency Lists: V => Set of neighbors of V

####Trees:

A tree is a connected graph without any cycles.



#####Binary Trees:
