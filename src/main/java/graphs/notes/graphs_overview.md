####Graphs:

A collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them. Graphs can either be:
* Directed (one way)
* Undirected (two way)

A graph may consist of multiple isolated subgraphs. If there is a path between every pair of vertices it is called a 'connected graph'. 

####Trees:

A tree is a connected graph without any cycles.



#####Binary Trees:
